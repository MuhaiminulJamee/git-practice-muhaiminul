# Project Description

## Project Title
Basic Calculator with Name and Date Display

---

## Introduction

This project is a simple Python-based application developed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and Git workflow practices. The application prints my name along with the current date and includes a basic calculator capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations.

The calculator feature was initially developed in a separate branch named `feature/calculator` and later merged into the `main` branch, demonstrating proper Git branching and merging techniques.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To understand basic Python programming
- To practice writing modular functions
- To implement arithmetic operations
- To learn Git branching and merging workflow
- To maintain clean and structured documentation

## Functional Description

### 1. Name and Date Display

The program:
- Prints the author's name
- Displays the date of submission

This ensures dynamic output based on the system date.

---

### 2️. Calculator Module

The calculator performs the following mathematical operations:

- Addition → `add(a, b)`
- Subtraction → `subtract(a, b)`
- Multiplication → `multiply(a, b)`
- Division → `divide(a, b)`

These functions are implemented in a separate utility file and are called in the main program file.

---

## Git Workflow

- The main functionality was implemented in the `main` branch.
- The calculator feature was developed in the `feature/calculator` branch.
- After successful implementation and testing, the feature branch was merged into the `main` branch.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Git
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Creating modular Python functions
- Working with multiple Git branches
- Merging feature branches into the main branch
- Writing structured project documentation
- Organizing a simple but clean project structure

---

## Conclusion

This project serves as a beginner-level demonstration of Python programming and Git version control. It highlights the importance of clean code structure, proper documentation, and organized workflow using branches.

Although simple, the project builds a strong foundation for larger and more complex software development tasks.
